### Hackathon questions answers

#### Summary of the project and the problem you are solving

The idea is to provide a service for quick and simple investing in multi-blockchain ICOs.

#### Brief background on the team and how you came up with the idea

Phil Filippak is a self-taught programmer who has worked on many different projects and participated in several coding competitions. He is an active open source contributor. He has a degree in economics and currently works as a front-end developer for the Waves platform.

Sergey Tolmachev has been a blockchain enthusiast since 2010. He is the co-founder and former CEO of BTCPay.ru. He has developed server-side solutions for a wide range of applications from mobile APIs to big data facilities. He works now on the back-end team of the Waves platform.

We spectated how ICOs were running and which issues the holders encountered and we realized that we should create a useful service for ICO holders and investors.

#### How is it innovative?

Lapti provides a complex approach to security and usability. Besides, no one has ever used the in-site widget for ICO before us.

#### What tools/platforms do you use?

We provide the service for Waves, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Any cryptocurrency can be processed by Lapti.

On backend: PostgreSQL, redis, Scala, nginx.

On frontend: jQuery, handlebars.

#### What was the biggest obstacle that your team overcame?

Lack of time and poor visual design. We also haven't had time to bind frontend to backend.
